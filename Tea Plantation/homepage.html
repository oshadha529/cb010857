            Sri Lanka is a tea-producing island. The nation produces tea all year round, with an annual production of about 340 million kilos. The central highlands and southern interior regions of Sri Lanka are primarily where tea is grown.

            The majority of the tea produced in the nation is currently exported as Ceylon Black Tea, while the nation also makes Ceylon Green Tea, a kind created from Assamese seedlings. Particularly Silver and golden tips of Ceylon White Tea, one of the most costly tea kinds in the world, are renowned for having the greatest flavor.

            <div id="teap">
            <p id="hp1">
                Nearly 5,000 years ago in ancient China, tea first appeared on record. Legend has it that Emperor Shen Nung discovered tea in 2732 B.C. when a wild tree's leaves blew into his pot of boiling water. He drank some after taking a sniff of the finished beverage, which had a pleasing aroma.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p id="hp2">
                Another legend describes how the Buddha dozed off while practicing meditation. He yanked out his eyelashes and dispersed them, annoyed with himself. Everywhere they landed, tea bushes flourished, allowing his disciples to stay awake while praying by drinking a beverage derived from their leaves.

                <p id="cth1">
                    A tea plant from China was first transported to Ceylon by the British in the year 1824. (as Sri Lanka was known at the time). It is thought to have been the first non-commercial tea plant in Sri Lanka and was established in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya.
                </p>

                <p id="cth2">
                    After almost two decades, James Taylor, a Scotsman, established the first commercial tea plantation on 19 acres at the Loolecondra Estate in Kandy, Ceylon. The first tea delivery to London was sent in 1873, and the eventual sale of Loolecondra teas occurred in Kandy in 1872. Through trial and error, these pioneering efforts were refined over time with the introduction and advancement of tea processing equipment and procedures by various people and businesses.

            <p id="teavarietiesintro">
                Ceylon tea is renowned for its exquisite flavor and richness around the world. Ceylon Tea is particularly unique because of the consideration and care that is put into its production.

                    <ul>
                        <li id="a">
                            The most oxidized kind of tea, Ceylon Black tea has the highest caffeine content. The ideal climate for growing black tea is hot and humid, with temperatures that do not drop below 55 degrees Fahrenheit or rise over 95 degrees. Due to its proximity to the equator, Sri Lanka's climate is perfect for growing and producing black tea.

                        Due to its unique processing, which helps it maintain its components that are ultimately good for your health, green tea is high in antioxidants. Ceylon green tea has a greater volume and a flavor that is slightly malty, nutty, and aromatic.

                            Ceylon white is famously known as "Silver Tips", it is also one of the most expensive teas in Sri Lanka. The same plant that yields black and green teas also yields ceylon white tea, and although the plant itself differs slightly. White tea is the least processed tea of all and is filled with health benefits since the leaves and buds are allowed to wither in the sun before being lightly processed to prevent oxidation. Due to the hue it takes on after the production process.
