                    <h2>Ceylon Tea Museum</h2>
                <p>
                    The Ceylon Tea Museum is housed in a structure that was previously the Hatane Tea Factory, built in 1925, and is located about four kilometers south of Kandy. The Ceylon Tea Museum was incorporated into the abandoned tea factory in 1998 by Clifford Ratwatte, the chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board. The tea plant had been abandoned for more than ten years prior. The building was renovated for its new purpose as a museum, and it was formally opened to the public on December 1st, 2001, thanks to the efforts of the Tea Board and the Planters' Association of Sri Lanka.
                    <br><br>
                    Among the pioneers of the Sri Lankan tea industry are Thomas Lipton, a fellow Scotsman, and James Taylor, a Scottish tea planter who brought tea to Ceylon and began selling it in Western markets in the 1890s. Both are featured in the exhibits of the Ceylon Tea Museum. The museum has four stories; on the bottom and second floors, visitors may see old tea processing equipment from the 19th century, including sorting machines, rollers, dryers, fermentation tables, and generators. A tea shop can be found on the third floor, while the first floor is home to a library and auditorium featuring audio and video shows.After completing the museum tour, visitors can enjoy a complimentary cup of tea in the tearoom on the top floor, which offers spectacular views of the nearby cities, hills, and planted tea gardens.
